# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

The data included in this repository describes the different bacteria people have in their belly button. Several volunteers allowed Improbable Beef, a faux beef company, to take samples from from their navel. Improbable Beef will then sort through those samples looking for certain bacteria that can be used to make their faux meat. In order to visualize the results of the study, we created a webpage that displays a bar chart showing the top 10 bacteria found, a gauge chart showing how often that test subject washes their navel, and a bubble chart showing the amount of each bacteria present. In the upper left part of the page, there is also a drop down menu where you can select different test subject id numbers so that the participants can confidentially view their results. Improbable Beef will let the participants know which bacteria they are looking for, that way the participant can check to see if that bacteria is present in their sample. If the desired bacteria is present, Improbable Beef is interested in having that individual stick around so that they can provide additional samples.
